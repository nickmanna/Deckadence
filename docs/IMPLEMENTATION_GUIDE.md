## 1. Overview

Deckadence is a cloud-based, multi-user DJ platform with two halves:

1. A **track analysis pipeline** — upload audio, a Python backend detects
   BPM/key/beatgrid, and the result is stored per-user in Firebase.
2. **Green Room** — a browser-based virtual DJ mixer (2-4 decks) for
   practicing/performing with that analyzed library, including support for
   a real Pioneer DDJ-FLX4 controller over Web MIDI.

Current end-user capabilities:

- Upload a track (mp3/wav/flac/ogg/m4a/aac) and get BPM, key (+ Camelot),
  and a real detected beatgrid back.
- Browse/filter a personal track library (by BPM range, key) with waveform
  previews.
- Mix live in Green Room: per-deck play/cue/loop (in/out/4-beat/½/×2)
  with beatgrid-quantized cue and loop points, pitch control, per-channel
  faders + crossfader, 2CH/4CH layout toggle.
- **Beat sync** — press SYNC on a deck to match its tempo (and snap its beat
  phase) to whichever other deck is currently playing; tempo continues to
  track live while sync is engaged.
- Drive Green Room's left/right decks from a real DDJ-FLX4 (play, cue, loop,
  channel faders, tempo fader, crossfader) over Web MIDI.

### 1.1 Architecture — Current State

| Layer | Technology | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | React 19 (CRA), react-router-dom | UI, all playback (`<audio>` + Web Audio), MIDI |
| Auth | Firebase Auth | User accounts |
| Data | Firestore (client SDK, direct from browser) | Track documents, user stats, memory cues |
| File storage | Firebase Storage | Uploaded audio files |
| Analysis backend | Flask + librosa (Cloud Run) | Stateless BPM/key/beatgrid analysis only |

```
Browser (React)
   ├──▶ Firebase Auth / Firestore / Storage   (track CRUD, audio files, user data)
   └──▶ Flask backend (Cloud Run)             (POST /api/analyze → BPM/key/beatgrid)
```

The Flask backend is **stateless** with respect to track data: `main.py`
does carry a `tracks_collection` in-memory dict and matching `/api/tracks*`
endpoints, but the frontend does not use them — `TrackService`
(`deckadence/src/services/trackService.js`) writes the analyzed track
document straight to Firestore from the client after calling
`/api/analyze`. Anything in that in-memory store is lost on every Cloud Run
cold start and isn't part of the real data path (see [8. Known Gaps](#8-known-gaps--tech-debt)).

The user's track list is fetched from Firestore **once per session** (via
`TrackCacheContext`, see [5.6](#56-track--audio-caching)) rather than by
each page independently — Discover/Library/Green Room all read the same
in-memory cache instead of each firing its own Firestore query on mount.

Every deck in Green Room owns its own playback state independently (its own
`<audio>` element, its own loop/cue/pitch/sync state via `useDeckPlayer`) —
there is no shared audio graph or master clock across decks. Mixer-level
state (per-channel gain, crossfader) is the one thing lifted up to
`GreenRoom.js`, since it needs to be a single source of truth across every
visible deck at once.

### 1.2 Architecture — Planned

- EQ per channel — needs each deck's audio routed through Web Audio
  `BiquadFilterNode`s instead of plain `<audio>` element playback (today's
  playback engine only reaches for Web Audio during active loops).
- DDJ-FLX4 hardware SYNC button wired to the new software sync (see
  [7. Roadmap](#7-roadmap)).
- Lighting/show control — does not exist yet in any form; "Green Room" is
  purely the DJ-mixer page name, not a lighting concept.

## 2. Prerequisites

| Component | Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | 18+ | Create React App 5 / React 19 |
| npm | bundled with Node | `deckadence/package.json` scripts |
| Python | 3.11+ | Matches `Dockerfile`'s base image |
| Firebase project | Auth + Firestore + Storage enabled | See [FIREBASE_SETUP.md](FIREBASE_SETUP.md) |
| Browser | Chrome or Edge | Web MIDI API required for DDJ-FLX4 support (Firefox/Safari don't support it) |
| Pioneer DDJ-FLX4 | Optional | Only needed to test hardware MIDI control; Green Room fully works with mouse/keyboard without it |
| gcloud CLI | Latest | Only for manual Cloud Run deploys / CI setup |
| firebase-tools | Latest | Only for manual Hosting/Firestore-rules deploys |

## 3. Environment Configuration

The frontend reads all config from `deckadence/.env` (copy from
`.env.example`, gitignored, never commit real values):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY` | Firebase web config |
| `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` | Firebase web config |
| `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` | Firebase web config |
| `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` | Firebase web config |
| `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` | Firebase web config |
| `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID` | Firebase web config |
| `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID` | Firebase web config |
| `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` | Base URL of the Flask analysis backend (defaults to `http://localhost:5000`) |

Note: a Firebase web `apiKey` etc. are not secrets in the way a service
account key is — see [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) for why, and for what
*does* need to stay server-side only.

The backend (`main.py`) currently takes no required environment
configuration beyond what Cloud Run injects (`PORT`).

## 4. Local Setup — Step by Step

### Step 1 — Frontend

```bash
cd deckadence
cp .env.example .env      # then fill in Firebase values
npm install
npm start                 # http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 2 — Backend

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py            # http://localhost:5000
```

### Step 3 — Verify

- `curl http://localhost:5000/api/health` → `{"status": "healthy", ...}`
- Sign up / log in on the frontend, upload a track under **Track Analysis**,
  confirm BPM/key/beatgrid come back and the track appears in **Track
  Library**.
- Open **Green Room**, drag a track onto a deck, hit play. Load a second
  track on the other deck, hit its **SYNC** button while the first is
  playing, and confirm its tempo/pitch value snaps to match.
- (Optional) Plug in a DDJ-FLX4, click **Connect MIDI** in Green Room's top
  bar, confirm the status changes to `🎛️ MIDI: L/R decks` and the hardware
  transport controls respond.

## 5. Feature Reference

### 5.1 Track Analysis (`POST /api/analyze`)

Stateless endpoint — accepts a multipart file upload, returns analysis
results. Does not persist anything server-side today (see [1.1](#11-architecture--current-state)).

Implemented in `trackanalysis.py` (`TrackAnalyzer`):

- **BPM** — bass/kick-emphasized onset envelope → `librosa.beat.beat_track`
  → cleaned (outlier-corrected) beat times → tempo from the median beat
  interval.
- **Key** — weighted chromagram analysis, reported as both a musical key and
  Camelot wheel notation.
- **Beatgrid** — the actual cleaned detected beat timestamps (not a
  synthetic constant-tempo grid) plus an estimated downbeat offset.

### 5.2 Track Library / Firestore Track Document

Written by `TrackService.saveTrack` after analysis. Key fields consumed by
the player (`deckadence/src/hooks/useDeckPlayer.js`):

| Field | Used for |
|---|---|
| `bpm` | Jog wheel BPM readout, sync tempo matching, un-quantized loop-length fallback |
| `beatgrid` / `beatGrid` | Quantized cue/loop placement, beat-sync phase alignment |
| `downbeatOffset` | Reserved — not yet consumed by the frontend |
| `storagePath` / `downloadURL` | Resolving the playable audio file from Firebase Storage |

### 5.3 Green Room — Virtual Mixer

`deckadence/src/components/GreenRoom.js` owns the mixer-level state; each
channel renders a `Deck` (`Deck.js`), whose actual playback engine is
`useDeckPlayer`.

| Control | Behavior |
|---|---|
| 2CH / 4CH toggle | Switches how many of the 4 possible channels are visible |
| Per-channel fader × crossfader | Computed in `GreenRoom.js` (`getEffectiveVolume`), passed into each deck as `externalVolume` — the mixer is the single source of truth for gain |
| CUE | CDJ-style: stop+return-to-cue while playing, preview-while-held when paused at cue, drop new cue point otherwise |
| Loop IN / OUT / 4 / ½ / ×2 | Beatgrid-quantized when quantize (`Q`) is on |
| Pitch | 0.9-1.1× playback rate; locked while SYNC is engaged |

### 5.4 Beat Sync

Per-deck `SYNC` toggle (`Deck.js`, logic in `useDeckPlayer.js`).

- **Target selection** — `GreenRoom.js`'s `getSyncTargetForDeck`:
  1. If a manual master is set (`masterDeckId`, toggled via each deck's
     `M` button — mutually exclusive, one master at a time), every other
     deck targets it unconditionally, whether or not it's currently
     playing. The master deck itself has no target (nothing to sync to).
  2. Otherwise, falls back to whichever *other* visible deck is currently
     playing (first match in on-screen channel order) — the pre-master-UI
     behavior, still the default with nothing manually set.
  A deck's own `SYNC` button is disabled while it *is* the master (and its
  sync auto-disengages if it becomes master while already synced to
  something else — see `Deck.js`'s `isMaster` effect).
- **Tempo** — polled every 250ms while sync is on; this deck's
  `playbackRate` is set to `targetBPM / ownTrackBPM`, clamped to the same
  0.9-1.1 range as the manual pitch slider.
- **Phase** — snapped once, at the moment sync is engaged and again every
  time this deck goes from paused to playing while synced (not
  continuously — continuous phase correction would be audibly perceptible
  as pitch wobble). Uses each deck's real detected beatgrid via
  `findNearestBeatIndex` (`beatQuantize.js`), not an assumed constant
  interval. The paused→playing snap runs inside the same effect that calls
  `audio.play()` (gated on `audio.paused`, not a "was playing" ref), and
  runs *before* `.play()` — the deck starts already in phase rather than
  playing a frame from the old position and then jumping.
- If no master is set and no other deck is playing, SYNC arms but is a
  no-op until a target becomes available.
- **Waveform display** — `Waveform.js`'s DJ view scales its visible time
  window by `playbackRate`, so two decks beat-synced to the same effective
  BPM show their beatgrids scrolling past the playhead at the same visual
  rate, matching the audio. Before this, the view's zoom was computed from
  each deck's own `duration` with no `playbackRate` term at all, so two
  tracks of different lengths and/or different pitch adjustments could be
  correctly beatmatched in audio while still looking visually out of step
  (see `ZOOM_REFERENCE_SECONDS` in `Waveform.js`).

### 5.5 DDJ-FLX4 MIDI Controller

`deckadence/src/hooks/useDdjFlx4.js`, mapped from Pioneer's official MIDI
message list (`DDJ-FLX4_MIDI_message_List_E1.pdf`, repo root).

| Hardware control | Wired to |
|---|---|
| Play/Cue/Loop IN/OUT/4-beat/½/×2 | Deck transport (channel 0 = left deck, channel 1 = right deck) |
| Channel fader | `channelFaders` mixer state |
| Tempo fader | Deck's `playbackRate` (0.9-1.1 range) |
| Crossfader | `crossfader` mixer state |
| **SYNC button** | **Not wired yet** — no note number captured from the MIDI PDF (needs `poppler-utils`/similar to extract, or the value pulled from Pioneer's spec directly); would call the same `toggleSync` the on-screen button uses |

Only 2 physical decks exist on the hardware, mapped to Green Room channels 1
and 2 regardless of 2CH/4CH mode — channels 3/4 have no physical deck to
receive MIDI from.

### 5.6 Track & Audio Caching

`deckadence/src/contexts/TrackCacheContext.js` — a single in-memory cache
of the signed-in user's track list, shared by Discover, Track Library, and
Green Room via `useTrackCache()`.

- **Loaded once per session**, right when a user becomes available
  (`currentUser` changing in `AuthContext`), not ad hoc by whichever page
  happens to mount — before this existed, Discover (`getUserStats`),
  Library (`getUserTracks`), and Green Room (`getUserTracks` +
  `getUserStats`) each ran their own independent Firestore fetch on every
  mount, so navigating between them re-fetched the same data repeatedly.
- **Stats are derived locally** (`computeStats`) from the same cached
  array instead of a second Firestore round trip — `getUserStats` on
  `TrackService` still exists but nothing calls it anymore.
- **Optimistic insert on save** — `TrackAnalysisPage`'s save flow calls
  `addTrack()` after `TrackService.saveTrack` succeeds, so a newly saved
  track appears in Library/Green Room immediately rather than waiting on
  the next full refetch.
- **`refresh()`/`patchTrack()`** are exposed for cases that do need to
  invalidate or update one cached entry, but nothing calls them yet.

Separately, `TrackService.getAudioFile` (the fallback audio-loading path
used when a track has a `storagePath` but no persisted `downloadURL`)
caches each resolved Storage download URL in a module-level `Map` keyed by
`storagePath`, so `getDownloadURL()` — itself a network round trip — only
runs once per track per session instead of on every load. Tracks saved
through the normal upload flow already have `downloadURL` persisted on the
Firestore document (see 5.2), so this fallback path is mostly a safety net
for legacy/edge-case tracks; the common case skips straight to
`audio.src = track.downloadURL` and lets the browser stream/cache it
natively.

## 6. Security Model

| Control | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Auth | Firebase Auth; Firestore/Storage rules scope reads/writes to `request.auth.uid` matching the resource owner |
| Client config | Firebase web `apiKey` etc. are env vars, not hardcoded — but are not secret once bundled; real protection is Firestore/Storage rules + HTTP-referrer key restriction |
| Upload validation | Backend rejects file extensions outside `mp3/wav/flac/ogg/m4a/aac`; 100MB request cap (`MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`) |
| CI/CD credentials | GitHub Actions → GCP via Workload Identity Federation; no long-lived service account key ever leaves Google |
| Deploy service account | Least-privilege, dedicated — not a personal or Owner-role account |
| **Backend CORS** | **Fully open** (`CORS(app)`, no origin restriction) on a publicly reachable, unauthenticated Cloud Run service — any site can call `/api/analyze` today |
| Firebase App Check | Not yet enabled |

See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) for the full list of what's done vs. what
still needs a human decision (API key rotation, CORS scoping, App Check).

## 7. Roadmap

- [ ] Wire DDJ-FLX4 hardware SYNC button to `toggleSync` (blocked only on
      pulling the note number from the MIDI PDF).
- [ ] Per-channel EQ (needs a Web Audio filter-node signal path per deck).
- [ ] Explicit "sync master" designation, if implicit (whichever deck is
      already playing) proves confusing with 4 decks.
- [ ] Decide the fate of `main.py`'s in-memory `tracks_collection` /
      `/api/tracks*` endpoints — either wire them to real persistence or
      remove them, since the frontend doesn't use them today.
- [ ] Scope backend CORS to the deployed frontend origin(s); consider
      requiring a verified Firebase Auth token before `/api/analyze` sees
      production traffic.
- [ ] Enable Firebase App Check.
- [ ] Social features / shared playlists (per `CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE.md`'s
      original migration path — not started).

## 8. Known Gaps / Tech Debt

- `docs/BACKEND.md`'s documented `/api/analyze` response shape doesn't match
  `main.py`'s actual output (the doc predates the current `TrackAnalyzer`
  integration) — trust `main.py`/`trackanalysis.py` over that doc until it's
  refreshed.
- `main.py` maintains an in-memory `tracks_collection` and `/api/tracks*`
  CRUD endpoints that nothing in the frontend calls — real track persistence
  goes through `TrackService` straight to Firestore. Don't build new
  features against the backend's endpoints assuming they're the source of
  truth for track data.
- No shared master clock across Green Room decks — beat sync (5.4) is a
  best-effort tempo/phase match, not sample-accurate lockstep playback.
- `TrackCacheContext` (5.6) is in-memory only and scoped to one browser
  session — a track edited/liked/deleted in another tab or device won't
  show up here until the tab reloads (nothing currently mutates a track
  after save, so this isn't yet a real inconsistency, just a limitation to
  keep in mind once something does).

## 9. Troubleshooting

### Frontend shows a blank page / Firebase errors on load
- Confirm `deckadence/.env` exists and every `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_*` value is
  filled in (copy from `.env.example`).
- Restart `npm start` after editing `.env` — CRA only reads it at startup.

### Track upload fails / "Analysis failed"
- Confirm the backend is running and `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` points at it.
- Check the backend console output — `trackanalysis.py` logs each analysis
  stage; a truncated/corrupt audio file is the most common cause.
- In production, check Cloud Run memory — a real upload has previously
  OOM-killed the default 512Mi instance (see `DEPLOYMENT.md` §4a); current
  sizing is 2Gi/2CPU.

### DDJ-FLX4 not connecting
- Web MIDI requires Chrome or Edge — Firefox and Safari don't implement it.
- The browser only prompts for MIDI permission from a real user gesture —
  click **Connect MIDI** rather than expecting auto-connect.
- Confirm the controller shows up in the OS as a MIDI device before
  blaming the app.

### Beat sync doesn't seem to do anything
- With no manual master set, SYNC only has an effect once an *other*
  visible deck is actually playing — it arms silently otherwise and starts
  correcting as soon as one is.
- If a manual master (`M`) is set, confirm it's set on the deck you expect
  — only one deck can be master at a time, and the master deck's own SYNC
  button is disabled (it has nothing to sync to).
- Confirm both decks' tracks have a detected `bpm` (an unanalyzed/mock track
  won't have one).

## Change Log

| Version | Date | Author | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.3 | 2026-07-09 | Nick Manna | Added a manual sync master: each deck gets an `M` toggle (`GreenRoom.js`'s `masterDeckId`, mutually exclusive) that other decks target unconditionally when set, overriding the "whichever other deck is playing" auto-fallback. A deck's own SYNC disables while it is the master. |
| 1.2 | 2026-07-09 | Nick Manna | Fixed beat sync (5.4): `Waveform.js`'s DJ view now scales its visible time window by `playbackRate` (previously computed from each deck's own `duration` with no tempo term), so synced decks' beatgrids scroll at the same visual rate instead of drifting apart on screen despite matching audio. Also moved the paused→playing phase snap to run before `audio.play()` instead of after, gated on `audio.paused` rather than a separate "was playing" ref. |
| 1.1 | 2026-07-09 | Nick Manna | Added `TrackCacheContext` (5.6) — track list + derived stats now load once per session and are shared across Discover/Library/Green Room instead of each page re-fetching from Firestore on mount; `TrackService.getAudioFile` now caches resolved GCS download URLs per session too. |
| 1.0 | 2026-07-09 | Nick Manna | Initial implementation guide — captures track analysis pipeline, Green Room virtual mixer, beat sync, and DDJ-FLX4 MIDI support as of this date. |
